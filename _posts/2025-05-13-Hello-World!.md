Hi there!!! I'm Bianca Fonseca, a cybersecurity student currently pursuing the [CYBERUS Erasmus Mundus Master’s program](https://master-cyberus.eu/), specializing in IoT security.

This website is my little corner of the internet where I’ll be sharing my cybersecurity journey.  
I’m starting this blog not because I have all the answers (FAAAAAAAAAAR from it) but because I have <ins>so many</ins> questions, so I figured "*why not document the process of finding those answers?*". Think of this as a public learning journal, part write-ups, part projects, part “AHHHH WHAT IS THIS?”.

I’m still figuring out the best formats and posting rhythm, but it’ll be as I go, whenever I learn something cool, confusing or worth sharing (so hopefully often).

This blog is especially for:
- beginners like me who sometimes feel behind (you’re *definitely* not! :p)  
- folks who want digestible cybersecurity content  
- anyone curious about what it’s like to learn this stuff from the ground up  

It’s really never too late, or too early, to start learning something new, so come check all the error messages with me!

Whether you’re a fellow student, a very very experienced pentester peeking in and chuckling or someone who just googled “what is a port scan?”, **welcome**! Let’s break things, fix them and learn (preferably in that order ehehehe).

Thanks for stopping by!
