### ✏️ LAN
**Local Area Network**

## **M**
### ✏️ MAC address
**Media Access Control address** or **Medium Access Control address** is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller for use as a network address in communications within a network segment. It is usually expressed in hexadecimal format with colons or hyphens separating the bytes (e.g., `a4:c3:f0:85:ac:2d`), sometimes there is no separator. The three leftmost bytes identify the vendor (in the previous example `a4:c3:f0` identifies Intel).

### ✏️ OSI model
The **Open Systems Interconnection** model is a conceptual model developed by [ISO](#%EF%B8%8F-iso) that describes how communications should occur in a computer network, i.e., it defines a framework for computer network communications. Although this model is theoretical, it is vital to learn and understand as it helps grasp networking concepts on a deeper level. The OSI model is composed of seven layers:
#### Physical Layer (Layer 1)
**Main function**: physical data transmission media

**Example Protocols and Standards**: electrical, optical and wireless signals

#### Data Link Layer (Layer 2)
**Main function**: reliable data transfer between adjacent nodes

**Example Protocols and Standards**: Ethernet (802.3), WiFi (802.11)

#### Network Layer (Layer 3)
**Main function**: logical addressing and routing between networks

**Example Protocols and Standards**: IP, ICMP, IPSec

#### Transport Layer (Layer 4)
**Main function**: end-to-end communication and data segmentation

**Example Protocols and Standards**: UDP, TCP

#### Session Layer (Layer 5)
**Main function**: establishing, maintaining and synchronising sessions

**Example Protocols and Standards**: NFS, RPC

#### Presentation Layer (Layer 6)
**Main function**: data encoding, encryption and compression

**Example Protocols and Standards**: Unicode, MIME, JPEG, PNG, MPEG

#### Application Layer (Layer 7)
**Main function**: providing services and interfaces to applications

**Example Protocols and Standards**: HTTP, FTP, DNS, POP3, SMTP, IMAP

### ✏️ TCP
**Transmission Control Protocol** is a connection-oriented transport protocol. It uses various mechanisms to ensure reliable data delivery sent by the different processes on the networked hosts. It is a layer 4 protocol. Being connection-oriented, it requires the establishment of a TCP connection before any data can be sent.
### ✏️ TCP/IP
**Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol** or **Internet protocol suite** is an actual implemented model. 

### ✏️ Telnet
**Teletype Network** protocol is a network protocol for remote terminal connection. Simply put, *telnet*, a TELNET client, allows you to connect to and communicate with a remote system and issue text commands. 
## **U**
### ✏️ UDP
**User Datagram Protocol** is a simple connectionless protocol that operates at the transport layer, i.e., layer 4. Being connectionless means that it does not need to establish a connection. UDP does not even provide a mechanism to know that the packet has been delivered.
